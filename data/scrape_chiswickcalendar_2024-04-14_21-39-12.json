What better way to start it than with a comedy, says director Guy Fairbanks.The Government Inspector, by Nikolai Gogol, was written about Tsarist Russia in the 1840s. A rake is staying in a small town inn, unable to pay his bill. But help is at hand. The Mayor has had a letter warning him that there is a Government Inspector due to descent upon the town.\u201cIt\u2019s a classic piece of mistaken identity\u201d says Guy. \u201cA farce.\u201dPutting two and two together and making six, the Mayor decides the man at the inn must be the inspector and proceeds to wine and dine him and suffers the cad flirting with both his wife and his daughter.Images above: Rehearsals are progressing nicelyPhilip Goulding has adapted the play to fit 1860s Britain. The setting is an indiscriminate provincial town, and the humour translates easily, says, Guy, as the good burgers of where ever it is in England are just as greedy to take the opportunity they think they see for advancement and perhaps the chance to get to London and the big time, as were the Russian townspeople.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where you are in the world, people identify with this kind of corruption\u201d says Guy, \u201cand the play is still very funny. We read it at one of our monthly paly readings and we all really enjoyed it\u201d.They considered cancelling the production, as\u00a0Bryony Wilman, the member of St Michael\u2019s Players who died recently, was due to be in it.\u201cWe decided she would want us to go ahead\u201d says Guy, \u201cand we hope we can put on a show she will be proud of.\u201dThe Government Inspector, by St Michael\u2019s Players, will be performed at St. Michael\u2019s Centre, Elmwood Road, Chiswick, W4 3DY, from 17 \u2013 20 April.\u00a310, book at\u00a0stmichaelsplayers.comSupport The Chiswick Calendar\n",
