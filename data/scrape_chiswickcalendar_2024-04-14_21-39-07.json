Sadiq Khan is defending his record, and up for election also are the 25 London Assembly members whose job it is to hold the mayor to account.

He has been very busy over the past few months, knocking on doors with his supporters and attending public events.Matt Smith has been talking to him and the other candidates for the\u00a0South West London seat, about the platforms on which they are standing and what they personally might bring to the role if elected.Ron Mushiso \u2013 Conservative\nRon\u2019s campaign materials for London Assembly election features an enlarged version of his name, with Conservative Party branding conspicuously minimised. He admits retaining this seat, which has always been held with a comfortable majority by a Conservative, is going to be a tough battle \u2013 not least because the unpopularity of the Tories at the national level is\u00a0 making it more difficult to campaign.The Chiswick Gunnersbury ward councillor is hoping to appeal to voters because of his life experience. He told our reporter Matt Smith the extraordinary personal story which brought him from a rural village in Uganda to London as a child and his experiences growing up in foster care.Read his interview here: 2024 London Assembly candidate Ron MushisoMarcela Benedetti \u2013 Labour\nThe SW London seat on the London Assembly has traditionally been a Conservative seat. Marcela thinks people in the south-west are ready for a change, and thinks they are ready to vote Labour.Marcela ia a Latin-American-European who has lived in London for 16 years. She brings her skills as a barrister working with victims of domestic violence. The role of the London Assembly is to hold the Mayor\u2019s office to account and she thinks her experience as a barrister would be useful in that role.Read her interview here: 2024 London Assembly candidate Marcela BenedettiGareth Roberts \u2013 Liberal Democrat\nGareth is the Leader of Richmond Council, with many years\u2019 experience as a borough councillot behind him. He thinks experience running local government is important if Members of the London Assembly are to have a realistic understanding of how things work.\u201cWhat we really need for the London Assembly are people who are experienced politicians, people who are experienced in London Government people are experienced in leadership and people who will be able to offer challenge to Sadiq Khan, but at the same time constructive challenge. Because at the moment, what we do tend to get particularly from the Conservatives is opposition for opposition\u2019s sake.\u201dRead his interview here: 2024 London Assembly candidate Gareth Roberts\n\nSteve Chilcott \u2013 Reform UK\nSteve has no previous experience in local government or politics, but is standing for Reform UK because, he says, people feel disenfranchised by all the traditional political parties.He is an HR professional who lives in Ealing.Read his interview here: 2024 London Assembly candidate Steve ChilcottChas Warlow \u2013 Green Party\nChas Warlow is one of five Green Party Councillors who made history to become the Official Opposition on Richmond Borough Council at the last local elections in 2021. In the 2021 London Assembly elections the Greens took three seats out of the 25 \u2013 one more than the Lib Dems and he says they are ambitious to build on their \u201cimpressive\u201d electoral performances in London.The single most important issue he would like to get across is the importance of helping residents insulate their houses and install low-carbon technology such as solar panels.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely vital that the Mayor ramps up support for home insulation and renewables\u201dGreen Party candidate Chas Warlow is the only one of the five who did not give us his time for an interview. Instead he sent us a statement.Chas Warlow \u2013 StatementSupport The Chiswick Calendar\n",
